- 👋 Hi, I’m @d4ndynoob
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies that help me grow professionally. I would also like to offer my services to clients to obtain an economic income.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS and trying to strengthen my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, Laravel. I also know a bit of Python, C++ & C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in the same technologies as me and who have the same desire to learn as I do.
- 📫 How to reach me ... daniel.solis5200@gmail.com
